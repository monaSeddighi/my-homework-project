          I have a great passion for coding. In October 2022 I won the SheCodes
          scholarship entitled the "SheCodes Foundation" which encourages women
          from developing countries to learn coding. There, I participated in
          hands-on Coding Workshops to learn and imporve my coding skills.
          During this period I have participated in different competition and I
          have submitted many projects.

            In this online workshop which lasted for three weeks I learned the
            basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The coding was done on VSCode
            and I learned how the Developer tool works, how to better
            communicate with developers, and what development paths are
            available.The workshop was project based. Each course contained
            videos with home work that we should submit at the end of each week.
            At the end of the three-week project we submitted the final project
            where the SheCode team members checked our work and if the project
            was valid we had the chance to go to the higher level which was
            called "The SheCodes Plus".

            During this eight-week online workshop we did an eight-week project
            and one final project. I have learned more advanced HTML, CSS and
            JavaScript coding skills. Combing these skills with Bootstrap and
            API I leaned how to build to build and deploy a weather app on
            GitHub. Also, the weather app site was built and deployed on
            Netlify, serverless backend services for web applications.

           In this five-week course with a final project I learned to code my personal working webpage in multiple HTML webpages. I learned more on how to make the page responsive for smaller screens using more advanced HTML, CSS, Bootstrap annd flexbox while controling the webpages with Devtools. Each HTML webpage was also SEO friendly.
